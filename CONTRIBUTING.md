# Contributing guide

The purpose of this guide is to ensure
that all files are committed according to the agreed standards
to improve the repository's performance and accessibility.

By following this guide, we can ensure that
the repository remains fast and accessible for everyone,
and that we are making the most efficient use of our storage space.

### Coding conventions

To optimize the code for readability, please follow these guidelines:

* Indent using two spaces (soft tabs).
* Consider the people who will read your code, and make it look nice for them.

We use a `clang-format` code formatter tool to format the code.

For example, to format file inplace, run:

    clang-format -i File.cs
